## Gene expression is encoded in all parts of a co-evolving interacting gene regulatory structure

Figure. Illustration of four genes (CDC6, RIO2, NSP1, EXG1) that carry a group of motif co-occurrence rules with a common motif (NHP6B transcription factor binding site, blue line) in their promoter region. The genes diverge in possessing 2 to 4 other DNA motifs (red lines) across the remaining regulatory regions (promoter, 5' and 3' UTRs and terminator), which repurpose the expression of these genes across a range of almost 3 orders of magnitude of expression levels. Red lines in the histogram denote the specific expression levels of the genes.
