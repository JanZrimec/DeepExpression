# DeepExpression

Gene expression is encoded in all parts of a co-evolving interacting gene regulatory structure

Figure. Illustration of four genes (CDC6, RIO2, NSP1, EXG1) that carry a group of motif co-occurrence rules with a common motif (NHP6B transcription factor binding site, BH adj. p-value < 0.005, SGD:S000002157 75, blue line) in their promoter region, whereas they all diverge in possessing 2 to 4 other DNA motifs (red lines) across the remaining regulatory regions. These genes span a 648-fold range of expression levels. Red lines in the histogram denote the specific expression levels of the genes.
